Hello everyone!

My name is Kenil. I am a software developer, voracious reader and a tireless seeker of knowledge. I have profound interest in programming and cyber security. Currently i am doing a little research on cryptocurrencies and cyber security to get an idea about the field and i am also planning to do my final year project in it.Also if it interests me, i might do my masters in one of those domains.  

I love coding and i usually code in java and python. I am not a pro but i am trying everyday to become one!

Lately i have been developing a great predaliction for financing and investing as well. I have become a big fan of Robert Kiyosaki in the recent past and these days my youtube recommendations would be full of speeches and seminars by that man lol.

I am an introvert and it takes some time for people to like me. I love to help people and it really makes me feel great if i become the reason for bringing even a little smile on somebody's face.

Apart from these i also love to travel, listen to music - mostly hindi and english songs and of course read lots and lots of books. I love reading fiction, biographies and self-improvement books. I always wanted to become a travel jockey but so far i couldn't become one. However five years down the road i would like to be a programmer who travels around the world, take freelancing projects and explore everything. To sum it up i would wanna EAT-TRAVEL-CODE.

I always wanted to write such stuffs about me and put it on the internet but i never did and i would have never done it if it wasn't for my friend Rijul aka <a href="https://github.com/aarengee">aaRengee</a>, who made me put this on here. Special thanks to him for collaborating with me.
